# Example Library of Code Samples

This project is a comprehensive example library of code samples in the areas of Java, Python, Ruby, C/C++, and Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript with React). Each folder contains numerous example programs designed to help you learn and understand various concepts and techniques in the respective programming languages.

## Java

The "Java" folder contains various example programs written in the Java programming language. Each program demonstrates the application of different Java concepts, including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, exceptions, input/output, and more. The example programs are well-commented to aid in understanding the code.

## Python

The "Python" folder houses a variety of example programs written in the Python programming language. Here, you will find examples of using functions, loops, conditions, lists, dictionaries, file operations, and other Python-specific features.

## Ruby

The "Ruby" folder includes example programs written in the Ruby programming language. It covers various Ruby concepts, such as classes, modules, methods, conditions, loops, and file processing.

## C/C++

The "C/C++" folder contains example programs written in the C and C++ programming languages. Here, you will find examples of using pointers, arrays, structures, functions, and other fundamental features of C/C++.

## Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript with React)

The "Web Development" folder is subdivided into "HTML," "CSS," and "JavaScript (React)" subfolders. Each subfolder contains examples related to web development:

- In the "HTML" subfolder, you will find examples of HTML files that represent the structure of a webpage.
- The "CSS" subfolder contains examples of CSS files that define the styling of a webpage.
- In the "JavaScript (React)" subfolder, you can explore examples of React applications that offer interactive features and dynamic content on a webpage.

The code samples in this section cover various aspects of web development, including responsive design, DOM manipulation, event handling, React components, and more.
